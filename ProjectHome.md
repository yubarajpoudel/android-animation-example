This example app is playing an animation of the Newton's cradle. For this purpose a frame-by-frame animation is defined in an xml file and then used within the activity to start the animation.

It's using the AnimationDrawable class to implement the frame-by-frame animation.

For a detailed tutorial on how to implement such an animation please refer to:
